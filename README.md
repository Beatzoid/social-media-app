# Depreciation

This repositiory is in a very broken state and is too much of a hassle to debug. Therefore, I am rewriting the whole project [here](https://github.com/Beatzoid/v-network-rewrite) and once that is done and working it will be merged into this repo. Until then, this repo will be archived.

# V-Network

A social media app made using the MERN stack

# Setup

1. `git clone` the repo
2. Rename [server/.env.example](server/.env.example) to .env and fill it out
3. Rename [client/.env.example](client/.env.example) to .env and fill it out
4. `cd server && yarn`
5. `cd ../client && yarn`
6. `cd ../server && yarn watch` to start the dev watch
7. Start a new terminal, cd into server, and run `yarn dev` to start the server
8. Start a new terminal, cd into client, and run `yarn start` to start the react app
